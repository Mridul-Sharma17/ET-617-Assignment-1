    "content": "Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It involves three main technologies: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML provides the skeleton of web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. CSS controls the visual presentation, including colors, fonts, and layouts. JavaScript adds dynamic behavior, enabling user interactions and data manipulation. Modern web development also includes frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js that simplify complex applications. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for anyone looking to build modern, responsive websites.",

Created by Facebook, React uses a component-based architecture that makes code reusable and maintainable. Key concepts include JSX (JavaScript XML) for writing component templates, state management for handling dynamic data, and props for passing data between components. React's virtual DOM efficiently updates the user interface by comparing changes and updating only what's necessary. Hooks like useState and useEffect provide functional components with state and lifecycle capabilities. Modern React development often includes tools like Create React App for quick setup, React Router for navigation, and state management libraries like Redux or Context API for complex applications.",

Common algorithms include linear regression for prediction, decision trees for classification, clustering for grouping similar data, and neural networks for complex pattern recognition. The ML workflow involves data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Popular tools include Python libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Applications span across industries: recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles.
