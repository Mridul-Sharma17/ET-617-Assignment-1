# Strictally follow the below rules, you will be penalised even if one of them is not followed:
# Always break any given problem into smaller manageable pieces which are easy to execute and move to next step only after ensuring current step is successfully managed. Always test current step temporarily before moving to next step.
# Always search on web before writing any code to avoid hallucinating and gaining knowledge of the updated tools and technologies.
# Always search on web for debugging.
# Always make all files with verbose logging, use best logging practices and use such logging library which provides detailed logging of each step, so that any issue if there is any is pinpointed.
# Always go through all the relevant workspace files and directories whenever debugging to understand how the setup is done instead of hallucinating.
# Always run servers (frontend or backend) in the background terminal using '&'.
